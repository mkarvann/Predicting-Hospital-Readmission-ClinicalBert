"colonoscopy on record will likely need age-appropriate screening in future. hematocrit remained stable during hospitalization. . #fen regarding the patient's diet, he understands that he is at chronic risk of aspiration given his laryngeal dysfunction. we recommend that the patient continue a dysphagia diet; however, given his tendency toward dehydration when drinking pre-thickened liquids only, we also recommend the patient initiate full liquids as well. the patient is at increased risk of aspiration with this diet, however without liberalizing his po intake he is unlikely to sustain adequate po's to prevent renal failure and otherwise decompensation. . in summary, the patient was admitted to the micu with severe aspiration pneumonia. he was treated w/ ceftriaxone x 10 days. home glyburide was discontinued and metformin was started. also discontinued were the following: lasix, neurontin, and flovent. medications on admission: aspirin 325mg po qdaily plavix 75mg po qdaily simvastatin 10mg po qam lasix 20mg po qam glipizide 10mg po qam combivent 103-18 2 puffs qid prn flovent 220 2puffs cozaar 25mg po qdaily flovent 220mcg 2 inhaleatoins neurontin 300mg po tid naprosyn 500mg po qdaily prn (not taking) discharge medications: aspirin 325 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). clopidogrel 75 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). simvastatin 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). ipratropium bromide 02 % solution sig: one (1) puff inhalation q6h (every 6 hours). losartan 25 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). clotrimazole 1 % cream sig: one (1) appl topical (2 times a day). nitroglycerin 4 mg tablet, sublingual sig: one (1) tablet, sublingual sublingual prn (as needed). albuterol sulfate 083 % (83 mg/ml) solution sig: one (1) puff inhalation q4h (every 4 hours). pantoprazole 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: one (1) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po q24h (every 24 hours). metformin 500 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po bid",1,147411
